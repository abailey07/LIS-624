## 2026-02-23 -  Week 6 reflection 

**Goal:** To us `apt` to update, install, and remove programs, and to install `yaz-client` to search the UK Libraries collection.

**Context:**  This feels like a significant step closer to our end of semester goal of installing an ILS.  The use of `apt` was pretty straightforward, but once I started using `yaz-client` to search records, I understand why we used `grep` last week.  I feel that helped to set up thinking about how to search and how it displays in CLI environment.

**Steps:** I followed the directions in the lecture and in our readings.  I also experimented on my own and thought along the lines of an expert researcher in music, and considered some of the unique terminology they would use.

**Results:** The actions of installation, updating, and removing programs felt easy.  Remembering the process will take time.
Again,it felt like I was creating search strings for research when using `yaz-client`.  I liked the direct ties we had to MARC fields through the Bib-1 Attributes, but I was disappointed how some of the obscure music ones didn't work for me. 

**Verification:** I spent time searching through Mozart's works, and tried to search by key using `@attr 1=1025` and by thematic number (Köchel numbers) using `@attr 1=1030`.  These were both unsuccessful as search fields, but I was able to use the Any field `@attr 1=1016` successfully for these.

**Notes:** Since I was in Indiana for my mom's birthday, my niece Evie watched me work on this.  She asked questions as I worked and we talked about how what I was doing compares to when she looks for a book in her school library or at the public library.
