# LIS-624
### All things related to LIS 624 in Spring 2026 semester

I am working to learning some of the skills a systems librarian needs to do their job effectively.  This repository will be used with a virtual machine running Linux where I will learn how to use a command line to create and execute programs related to systems librarianship.
This is all new to me.  I **struggled** with using DOS for games in the 90s, so this is a stretch for me.  I will be documenting my process.
