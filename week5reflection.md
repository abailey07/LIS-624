## 2026-02-15 -  Week 5 reflection 

**Goal:** To become familiar with the command `grep` and how to upload and search a BibTex file.

**Context:**  We are still building our foundational skills in the CLI, but this week added `grep` which felt similar to creating search strings.

**Steps:** I followed the directions in the lecture and in our readings.

**Results:** It felt like I was creating search strings for research.  In making specifics in `'grep`, we were able to search by keywords, get count, and do a little formatting to make things more readable in the VM.  These are things that an ILS does in its GUI for us, but in a CLI we have execute those commands ourselves. 

**Verification:** There were some errors along the way, particularly having failed partial commands.  In our discussion board, I learned that the `bash` will give another `>` as another opportunity to complete a mistyped commnad.  I can also use `ctrl-c` to cancel the command and get back to where I need to be.

**Notes:** I used `man grep` several times to look at some of the tack options.  It's still a bit overwhelming.
